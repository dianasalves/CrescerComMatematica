#Grow up With Math

  Dyscalculia is a specific neurological disorder that affects a person's ability to understand and manipulate numbers. Therefore, with this project, the intention was to develop an application that helps with the learning of basic mathematics (simple arithmetic), dedicated to children who attend the years of education up to the 4th year (equivalent years of schooling in the Portuguese educational system). This application incorporates problems associated with mathematics, and after solving them, didactic games, which stimulate memory, among other aspects, which capture the child's attention.

Features/Requirements:
  1. The system allows selecting the option “Desafios na página inicial” ("Challenges on the home page"); 
      1.1. After selecting “Desafios” ("Challenges"), another page will appear where the user can choose the following options: 
           "1ºAno de Escolaridade" (“1st year of schooling”), 
           "2ºAno de Escolaridade" (“2nd year of schooling”), 
           "3ºAno de Escolaridade" (“3rd year of schooling”), 
           "4ºAno de Escolaridade" (“4th year of schooling”); 
      1.2. After selecting one of the years of schooling, the challenge begins, consisting of 5 multiple-choice mathematical problems related to the subject taught in             the year; 
      1.3. At the end of each challenge, the user is shown how many questions he got right. Here you will have the option to redo the challenge or exit to the home                page.
      
  2. The system allows selecting the option "Jogos didáticos" (“Diactic games”) on the main page. 
      2.1. After selecting "Jogos Educacionais" (“Educational games”), a page should appear on which the user can select the educational game he wants to play. The                 rules will depend on each didactic game; 
      2.2. After clicking on educational games, a new page will appear with the following options: 
            "Jogo da Memória" (“Memory game”), 
            "Cálculo Rápido"(“Quick calculation”), 
            "Associação" (“Association”). 
      2.3. If the user chooses the first option, he will be taken to a new page where he has to choose the difficulty of the game, between easy, which gathers numbers            between 1 and 8, medium, with numbers between 1 and 16, and finally the chosen difficult, with numbers between 1 and 20. After choosing, the user is                    forwarded to the respective game page according to the chosen difficulty. Each difficulty works based on the same principle, each user has to find the                  corresponding pairs of all the numbers present, using memory as the main element and exercising it. 
      2.4. If the user chooses the Quick Calculation option, he will be forwarded to a new page that presents a sum and four possible answers, the game time is limited            to 30 seconds, however if the user gets 5 questions right in a row this time will be extended, the sums will also progressively increase in difficulty each            time the user hits a sum. 
      2.5. If the user chooses the Association option, he will go to a new page where he answers 10 questions in which he will have to associate cardinal numbers                  written numerically with their textual form and vice versa. For each question you will have four answer options, some of which are quite similar to the                right answer and others quite different. At the end of the 10 questions you will have to submit the answers and the result you obtained and a motivating                qualitative classification will be presented.
      
  3. The system has a function on all pages that allows you to hover the computer's mouse over words and have them be said at loud (text to speech).
  4. The system is in Portuguese (Portugal/Brazil);
  5. The system is responsive;
  6. The system contains only mathematical problems suitable for the age range of the target audience;
  7. The system has a simple and direct language.
